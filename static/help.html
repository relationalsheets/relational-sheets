            <h2>Creating Sheets</h2>
            <p>
                Click <code>Open > + New</code> to create a new sheet.
                This will open a modal where you can select the <i>primary table</i> the sheet should use
                and join additional tables. Only tables with foreign keys between them can be joined.
                Table names include the database schema&mdash;in most cases this will be "public".
            </p>
            <h2>Adding &amp; Editing Data</h2>
            <p>
                Click <code>Insert > Row</code> to insert a new row in the primary table.
                A blank row will appear at the top of the table with an "Add" button below it.
                You must enter values for all non-null, non-defaulted columns in the primary table,
                but entering values in joined tables is optional. If values are entered in a column
                on a joined table, "Add" will attempt to insert a row in the joined table as well
                and link it to the primary table via the foreign keys used to join the tables.
            </p>
            <p>
                Primary key columns are identified by a blue header. Clicking on a primary key cell
                will allow you to add rows to the other tables in the sheet which will be linked to
                the selected table, e.g. adding records to a many-to-one relationship. Values can be
                provided for any tables except the selected table, but the set of tables with values
                provided must have a path via foreign keys to the selected table.
            </p>
            <p>
                Click on an individual cell to edit it. Editing is only allowed on tables with primary
                keys. The database will be updated when on <code>Enter</code> or when you click outside
                of the cell.
            </p>
            <h2>Sorting, Hiding &amp; Filtering</h2>
            <p>
                Clicking on a database column header will cycle it between being unsorted, sorted
                descending, and sorted ascending. It is possible to sort on multiple columns at once,
                in which case the leftmost column will be the primary sort key and columns to the right
                will only be used to break ties.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>Ctrl+Click</code> on any column header to hide the column. If you accidentally hide
                columns you don't want to, you can unhide all columns by clicking <code>Edit > Show All Columns</code>.
                Hiding a column removes any sorting and filtering on that column.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hovering over the filter icon at the right of a database column header will allow you to
                define a filter on a column. This should be a partial SQL expression, where the column will
                be used as the left operand. For example, ">1" will filter the table to only include rows
                where that column has a value greater than 1. Filters can be removed by clearing out the
                filter input or clicking <code>Edit > Clear All Filters</code>.
            </p>
            <h2>Using the Spreadsheet</h2>
            <p>
                To the right of the database tables you can add <i>spreadsheet columns</i> where you
                can enter whatever data you want. Click <code>Insert > Column</code> to add a column.
                Values entered in the cells will be saved. Spreadsheet rows are not tied to database
                rows directly. If you wish to maintain the alignment of spreadsheet rows and
                database rows as more rows appear in your database, you should put an ascending order
                on a sequential ID or timestamp column so that new rows appear at the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like Excel, you can perform computations
                and reference other columns by entering a formula that begins with <code>=</code>,
                e.g. <code>=A1+B2</code> will add the values in first cell in column "A" and the second
                cell in column "B". Ranges are also supported when used with aggregation functions,
                e.g. <code>=SUM(A1:A3)</code> will return the sum of the first 3 cells in column "A"
                and <code>=SUM(A:A)</code> will return the sum of the entire column.
                Use <code>Ctrl+Click</code> on a cell with a formula in it to fill every cell below it
                with the same formula, with rows in cell references intelligently adjusted.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also reference cells from your database tables using the same syntax.
                E.g. if there is column named "foo" in one of your tables, the first cell shown in that table can be referenced
                as "foo1". If there are multiple columns with the same name, you can distinguish them by using a fully-qualified
                name, e.g. "public.mytable.mycolumn". Aggregation functions invoked with the whole column as the range will
                run against every row in the table, even if the sheet is not able to display all rows due to row limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spreadsheet columns support the following functions:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>IF(condition, value_when_true, value_when_false)</code></li>
                    <li><code>MAX(values...)</code></li>
                    <li><code>MIN(values...)</code></li>
                    <li><code>SUM(values...)</code></li>
                    <li><code>PRODUCT(values...)</code></li>
                    <li><code>AVERAGE(values...)</code></li>
                    <li><code>COUNTIF(condition_range, condition)</code></li>
                    <li><code>SUMIF(condition_range, condition[, sum_range])</code></li>
                    <li><code>AVERAGEIF(condition_range, condition[, sum_range])</code></li>
                    <li><code>REGEXMATCH(search_string, pattern)</code></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
